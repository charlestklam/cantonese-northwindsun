# Cantonese - The North Wind and the Sun 

Speech data with Praat TextGrid files 

# Read-Aloud Task

The text of the read-aloud task is an adaptation of the Cantonese "The North Wind and the Sun" in Zee 1991 (https://doi.org/10.1017/S0025100300006058). The text is presented in Cantonese text as the following: 

1. 北風同太陽
2. 有一次北風同太陽喺度拗緊邊個叻啲。
3. 佢哋啱啱睇到有個人行過，哩個人着住件大褸。
4. 佢哋就話嘞，邊個可以整到哩個人除咗件褸呢，就算邊個叻啲嘞。
5. 於是，北風就搏命噉吹。
6. 點知，佢越吹得犀利，嗰個人就越係嗱實件褸。
7. 最後，北風冇晒符，唯有放棄。
8. 跟住，太陽出嚟晒咗一陣，嗰個人就即刻除咗件褸嘞。 
9. 於是，北風唯有認輸啦。
